In S&C one of the most important equations is **V = I x R**

<b>V</b>oltage - (Also *Potential Difference*) The difference in energy levels between two points of a circuit. Measured in *Volts* (V). 

<b>I</b> - Current - The number of electrons that pass a given point per second. Measured in *Amps* (A) (From Ampères).  

<b>R</b>estistance - The measure of how good a substance is at conducting electricity. Measured in *Ohms* (Ω).    
 
Good conductors of electricity (like copper and gold) have very low resistance (1-2 Ω), while insulators (like rubber and plastic) have a high resistance (several million Ohms). 

###Resistors

To get the value of the above resistor you put the brown or gold band on the right and read from left to right.
