  <h3 id="woods">Woods</h3>

  <p><strong>Wood</strong> - <em>the hard fibrous material that forms the main substance of the trunk or branches of a tree or shrub</em></p>

  <p>Trees are cut down and the logs and branches are then worked into sheets of wood, or planks. As a natural product, they are sustainable (if the forest they come from is being re-planted), and have an attractive grain in the wood.</p>

  <p><strong>Softwood</strong> <br>
  Softwoods come from coniferous trees which are evergreen, needle-leaved, cone-bearing trees, such as cedar, fir and pine.</p>

  <p><strong>Hardwood</strong> <br>
  Hardwoods come from broad-leaved, deciduous trees. The main hardwood timbers are ash, beech, birch, elm, mahogany, oak and teak.</p>

  <h4 id="composite-woods">Composite Woods</h4>

  <p><strong>Manufactured boards</strong> - Man-made boards are those which are produced in factories. They tend to have a uniform appearance, and have unique properties. It is often cheaper and easier to buy composites rather than natural wood.</p>

  <h3 id="plastics">Plastics</h3>

  <p>Usually derived from oil, plastics provide a variety of durable materials which can be formed easily into whatever shape is required, and can be highly durable. Their relatively low cost has led to their popularity for use in all manner of every day objects. Unfortunately, plastics tend not to be easily bio-degradable (often taking several hundred years to break down in landfill), and as such need to be recycled wherever possible.</p>



  <h4 id="production">Production</h4>

  <p><strong>Natural</strong> <br>
  Natural sources of plastics include:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Plants</strong> - From which cellulose can be extracted</li>
  <li><strong>Trees</strong> - From which latex, amber and resin can be extracted</li>
  <li><strong>Animals</strong> - From which horn and milk (used to make glues) are obtained</li>
  <li><strong>Insects</strong> - From which shellac (used to make polish) is obtained</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Synthetic</strong> <br>
  Synthetic plastics are chemically manufactured from:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Crude oil</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Coal</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Natural gas</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Plastics can be either classed as <strong>thermosetting</strong>, or <strong>thermoplastic</strong> (thermosoftening). <br>
  When forming them into a shape, <em>thermosetting</em> polymers normally need to be mixed with a curing agent, which allows them to set solid. Once set, they cannot be re-formed into another shape. <br>
  <em>Thermoplastics</em> can be repeatedly heated until soft, then cast into a new shape and cooled.</p>

  <h3 id="metals">Metals</h3>

  <p>Metals come from ores which are dug from the ground, and purified. They can be cast into sheets, or ingots ready for forming into different shapes. <br>
  Some metals can be combined with other materials to form <strong>alloys</strong>, which have new, unique properties. Steel is made by combining iron and carbon, for instance. <br>
  Ferrous metals are those which contain iron.</p>
