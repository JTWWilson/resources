Joining Materials
------------------------

Materials can be joined either through *components*, *joints* or adhesives.

### Components

|Component|Description and Use|
|---------|-------------------|
|Nails|Made of mild steel, these are generally used where appearance is not important or where a quick job is needed.|
|Panel Pins|Made of mild steel, these are commonly used to fix backs onto cupboards and bottoms onto boxes.|
|Wood Screws|These are used to join metal/plastic to wood, or to join two pieces of wood to make a strong joint.|
|Machine Screws|These can be used to join two or more pieces of metal or plastic, thanks to their threaded design which allows for the use of nuts.|
|Bolts|Bolts are similar to machine screws, except they are only threaded for part of their length.|
|Pop Rivets|Pop rivets are usually only used when there is only access to one side of a material. The material must be thin in order for the river to work.|

### Wood joints

There are seven common joints when it comes to joining two pieces of wood at 90<sup>o</sup>.

### Adhesives

|Adhesive|Uses|
|--------|----|
|PVA|General purpose woodwork glue; some PVA glues are water-resistant.|
|Synthetic resin|Strong water-resistant glue for woodwork.|
|Epoxy resin|Water-resistant product used for joining metals and plastics.|
|Contact adhesive|Used for joining polystyrene and fabrics; also used for fixing plastic laminates to a wooden base.|
|Acrylic cement|Used for joining acrylic and some other types of plastics; the adhesive melts the surface of the plastic and fuses it together.|
