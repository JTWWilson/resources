Velocity and Acceleration
-----------

##Velocity

<span class="underline">Velocity</span> is a measure of how far an object is travels per unit of time **in a given direction**. The 'given direction' is very important; *how far an object is travels per unit of time* is simply **speed** (think metres/second), while **velocity** tells you the direction of that speed. As such, it is called a **vector quantity**, while speed is called a **scalar quantity** as it only has a magnitude, not a direction.
Velocity would be given with the units of speed *and* a direction, for example:
>5 ms<sup>-1</sup> east

##Acceleration
<span class="underline">Acceleration</span> is a measure of the *change in speed* of an object. For instance, if you are travelling at a constant speed,  you have no acceleration (0), while if you are getting faster, you are accelerating.  

![Acceleration = change in velocity over time](../Images/Equations/acceleration.png)

When you are slowing down, are *decelerating* or you can be said to have a *negative acceleration*.    
Acceleration is given by the units ms<sup>-2</sup> or metres per second per second, for example:
>The car is accelerating at 3ms<sup>-2</sup>

##Practice Questions

1) A car accelerates from 10ms<sup>-1</sup> to 30ms<sup>-1</sup> in 8 seconds. 
What is its acceleration?

**Answer**: 

![Acceleration = change in velocity over time](../Images/Equations/acceleration.png)

The car's velocity is changing from 10ms<sup>-1</sup> to 30ms<sup>-1</sup>, so the change is 20ms<sup>-1</sup>. It does this in 8 seconds, therefore:   
20ms<sup>-1</sup> / 8 = acceleration = 2.5ms<sup>-2</sup>
