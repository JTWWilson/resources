(P2.1) Forces and their Effects
-----

AQA sum up this topic with the following:

>Forces can cause changes to the shape or motion of an object. Objects can move in a straight line at a constant speed. They can also change their speed and/ or direction (accelerate or decelerate). Graphs can help us to describe the movement of an object. These may be distance time graphs or velocity-time graphs.

>Candidates should use their skills, knowledge and understanding to:

>- interpret data from tables and graphs relating to speed, velocity and acceleration
- evaluate the effects of alcohol and drugs on stopping distances
- evaluate how the shape and power of a vehicle can be altered to increase the vehicle's top speed
- draw and interpret velocity-time graphs for objects that reach terminal velocity, including a consideration of the forces acting on the object.
