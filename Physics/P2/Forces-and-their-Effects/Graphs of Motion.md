##Distance-Time

A *distance-time* graph, as the name suggests, plots the distance an object is away from a starting point and the time that it has taken. This graph tells you several things about the object's journey:

- From 0s-5s the distance travelled was 5m, therefore, since speed = distance / time, the speed of the object here is 5m / 5s = 1ms<sup>-1</sup>.   
- From 5s-7s the speed of the object is 0m / 7s = 0ms<sup>-1</sup> -- the object is stationary.   
- From 7s-10s the distance travelled was 5m, so the speed of the object here is 5m / 3s = 1.6ms<sup>-1</sup> (to 1 decimal place).    


##Velocity-Time

A *velocity-time* graph is similar to a distance-time graph but plots the *velocity* and the time that it has taken. Again, the graph tells you several things about the object's journey:

- From 0s-2s the velocity is constantly increasing -- accelerating -- and we can work out the acceleration as follows: acceleration= Δvelocity / time, the change in velocity is 4 - 0 = 0 so the acceleration = 4ms<sup>-1</sup> / 2s = 2ms<sup>-2</sup>.   
- From 2s-4s the velocity is constant and so is just 4ms<sup>-1</sup> -- the object is not accelerating or decelerating.   
- From 4s-10s the velocity is constantly decreasing -- decelerating. Acceleration =  Δvelocity / time so the change in velocity is 0 - 4 = -4 so the acceleration = -4ms<sup>-1</sup> / 6s = -0.6ms<sup>-2</sup> (to 1 decimal place). Since the acceleration is *negative*, it could also be referred to as deceleration.
- You can also work the total distance travelled on this graph by multiplying the velocity and the speed (think m/s * s = m); just work out the area of the space underneath the graph.
 - In this case, it is 4m + 8m + 12m (taken from splitting the shape up) which sums to 24m.
 - So, in this graph, the object has travelled 24m in total.
