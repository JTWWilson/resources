<h2 id="the-tipitaka">The Tipitaka</h2>
<div class="tooltip">The Tipitaka<span class="tooltiptext">Pali Canon - main Buddhist holy text</span></div> is the collection of writings that make up the core of Buddhist holy texts. They are over 2000 years old but written a few hundred years after in Pali, the language spoken by the Buddha. The name Tipitaka comes from '3 baskets' which is how the original documents - written on palm leaves - were stored. The three baskets are: **vinaya pitaka**, **sutta pitaka** and **abhidhamma pitaka**.
<p>Buddhist scriptures as a whole are incredibly long and as so are not read by many Buddhists but they are taught by monks who chant sections regularly. In some traditions, copies of the texts are treated with great respect, sometimes placed on shrines. Despite this, critical thinking towards the books is encouraged and the Buddha’s mortality is not disguised.</p>
