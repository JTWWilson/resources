- Each of the above constituents is one aspect of living that Buddhists try to follow
- It can be split up into **The Threefold Way**:
	- Meditation: Right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration
	- Morality: Right speech, right action and right livelihood
	- Wisdom: Right view, right intention
