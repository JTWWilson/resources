## Natural Moral Law
**Natural Moral Law** is the Catholic doctrine that asserts that God's laws can be *reasoned* through nature. It was developed by Saint Thomas Aquinas in the 13<sup>th</sup> Century and was thereafter added to the church's official canon. 

### Thomas Aquinas
Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) was the son of a noble Italian family but became a monk and was later made a saint and a doctor of the Catholic Church. He drew a lot of inspiration from Aristotle, whose work had previously been lost to the Christian world as the Greeks predated Christianity. Thus it is thought Aquinas somehow contacted Muslim scholars, to whom Aristotle was still available.

In his book, *Summa Theologica*, Aquinas sets out the basis of Natural Moral Law:
<ul><li> Everything in the world is going from its *Potentiality* to its *Actuality* via *motion*.</li>
<li> It is God's will that the correct actuality is fulfilled so anything a human does to impede this motion is sinful. </li>
<li>For example:
 <blockquote> A sperm's <div class="tooltip"><b>telos</b><span class="tooltiptext">Greek: purpose  or true meaning</span></div> is to fertilise an ovum. Therefore, impeding it (i.e. contraception) is sinful.</blockquote>
 Thus, the Catholic church bans contraception.</li></ul>

This reasoning comes from Aquinas' **Seven Basic Goods**; seven things he believed were pre-programmed into humans and as such came directly from God:
1. Life (Survival instinct)
2. Reproduction
3. Education of Offspring
4. Seek God
5. Live in Society
6. Avoid offence
7. Shun ignorance

Since these are present in all humans, it allows the Ancient Greek's work to be deemed moral because, although they did not know about Jesus, they did have access to their base morality from nature.

### Casuistry

Each Basic Good allows you to use reason to create some practical laws for life, for instance:
|Prohibition|Basic Good|Positive Injunction|
|-|-|-|
|Do not kill|Life|Help others|
|Do not use contraception|Reproduction|Try to have children|
 
 -----
 
 |Advantages|Disadvantages|
 |-|-|
 |Provides laws that help fill in the gaps left by scriptural revelation|Leaves the church preaching laws that are not in the Bible|
 |The laws are more up-to-date and practical than some of those in the Bible|It can be difficult to decide whether an action goes against a specific Basic Good or not
 |Has Biblical backing: <q>*They* [Gentiles] *show that what the law requires is written on their hearts*</q>|It is based on the work of non-Christians|
 |Can be used as part of a legal system|Is only applicable to those who believe in God|
