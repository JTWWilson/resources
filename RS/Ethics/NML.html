<h2 id="natural-moral-law">Natural Moral Law</h2>
<p><strong>Natural Moral Law</strong> is the Catholic doctrine that asserts that God’s laws can be <em>reasoned</em> through nature. It was developed by Saint Thomas Aquinas in the 13<sup>th</sup> Century and was thereafter added to the church’s official canon.</p>
<h3 id="thomas-aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</h3>
<p>Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) was the son of a noble Italian family but became a monk and was later made a saint and a doctor of the Catholic Church. He drew a lot of inspiration from Aristotle, whose work had previously been lost to the Christian world as the Greeks predated Christianity. Thus it is thought Aquinas somehow contacted Muslim scholars, to whom Aristotle was still available.</p>
<hr>
<p>In his book, <em>Summa Theologica</em>, Aquinas sets out the basis of Natural Moral Law:</p>
<ul><li> Everything in the world is going from its *Potentiality* to its *Actuality* via *motion*.</li>
<li> It is God's will that the correct actuality is fulfilled so anything a human does to impede this motion is sinful. </li>
<li>For example:
 <blockquote> A sperm's <div class="tooltip"><b>telos</b><span class="tooltiptext">Greek: purpose  or true meaning</span></div> is to fertilise an ovum. Therefore, impeding it (i.e. contraception) is sinful.</blockquote>
 Thus, the Catholic church bans contraception.</li></ul>
<p>This reasoning comes from Aquinas’ <strong>Seven Basic Goods</strong>; seven things he believed were pre-programmed into humans and as such came directly from God:</p>
<ol>
<li>Life (Survival instinct)</li>
<li>Reproduction</li>
<li>Education of Offspring</li>
<li>Seek God</li>
<li>Live in Society</li>
<li>Avoid offence</li>
<li>Shun ignorance</li>
</ol>
<p>Since these are present in all humans, it allows the Ancient Greek’s work to be deemed moral because, although they did not know about Jesus, they did have access to their base morality from nature.</p>

<p>Each Basic Good allows you to use reason to create some practical laws for life, for instance:</p>
