<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<p>A CPU is an integrated circuit that is responsible for performing arithmetic, logical and I/O operations. <br>
CPUs perform these operations as instructed by a computer program. <br>
A CPU is generally made up of two components <br>
  An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) <br>
  A control unit (CU)</p>



<h4 id="a-cpu-works-in-4-basic-stages">A CPU works in 4 basic stages:</h4>

<p><strong>Fetch</strong> - Instructions are fetched from the program in memory.</p>

<p><strong>Decode</strong> - Instructions are broken up for assignment to parts of the CPU</p>

<p><strong>Execute</strong> - Calculations and Logical operations are performed (such as addition)</p>

<p><strong>Writeback</strong> - Results of calculations are written back to memory.</p>



<h2 id="exam-definitions">Exam Definitions</h2>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Hardware and software working together to create a working solution</em></p>



<h4 id="psu">PSU</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>Power supply to convert main AC to DC voltage for the computer</em></p>



<h4 id="motherboard">Motherboard</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>The circuit-board to which all other core components are connected</em></p>



<h4 id="cpu">CPU</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: <em>A chip responsible for performing calculations These perform instructions at a particular clock-frequency (measured in GHz) which determines how fast they can process data.</em> <br>
Multi-core machines can perform tasks simultaneously where this is desired. </p>
