The CPU
-----------------


##Basics

A CPU is an integrated circuit that is responsible for performing arithmetic, logical and I/O operations.  
CPUs perform these operations as instructed by a computer program.  
A CPU is generally made up of two components  
  An arithmetic logic unit (ALU)  
  A control unit (CU)

####A CPU works in 4 basic stages: 
**Fetch** - Instructions are fetched from the program in memory.

**Decode** - Instructions are broken up for assignment to parts of the CPU

**Execute** - Calculations and Logical operations are performed (such as addition)

**Writeback** - Results of calculations are written back to memory.




##Exam Definitions

####Computer System
**Definition**: *Hardware and software working together to create a working solution*

####PSU
**Definition**: *Power supply to convert main AC to DC voltage for the comupter*

####Motherboard
**Definition**: *The circuit-board to which all other core components are connected*

####CPU
**Definition**: *A chip responsible for performing calculations These perform instructions at a particular clock-frequency (measured in GHz) which determines how fast they can process data.*
Multi-core machines can perform tasks simultaneously where this is desired.
