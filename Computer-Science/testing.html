<h2 id="application-testing">Application Testing</h2>



<h2 id="why-do-we-use-testing">Why do we use testing?</h2>

<p>Software testing is a vital part of software development. It is important because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It highlights defects and errors made during the development phase.</li>
<li>It ensures that the customers can rely on the product and that they are satisfied with it.</li>
<li>It ensures the quality of the product.</li>
<li>It ensures the effective performance of the application or product.</li>
<li>It saves time and money, in the future, correcting errors and bugs.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="types-of-testing">Types of testing</h2>

<p>Most testing can be broken up into two types: <strong>unit testing</strong> and <strong>modular testing</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="unit-testing">Unit Testing</h3>

<p>In unit testing, individual blocks of code are tested. These might be individual functions or classes. <br>
This type of testing is often carried out during the development phase, and the programmer would keep <br>
detailed documentation on the tests that have been carried out. Unit testing is an excellent way of <br>
ensuring small bugs and faults in the code are picked up early, however it does not test integration <br>
with other parts of the program very well though.</p>



<h3 id="modular-testing">Modular Testing</h3>

<p>Modular testing would test some aspect of the finished software. This might be a test on the Graphical <br>
User Interface (GUI) or perhaps integration with a database. These tests are normally carried out by <br>
specialist testers, who would keep detailed documentation on the tests to feedback to the developers. <br>
Modular testing is used to give reassurance to the developers and customers that the whole application <br>
works as intended. However, it is a fairly lengthy and complicated process.</p>



<h2 id="trace-tables">Trace Tables</h2>

<p>Sometimes, when writing an algorithm, you use a <strong>trace table</strong> to <em>trace</em> the changes that occur to a variable throughout the program. As this method of testing is simple and can be performed <em>without</em> (!) a computer, it is favoured by exam boards to examine testing ability.</p>
