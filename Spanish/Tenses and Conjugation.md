Tenses and Conjugation

###An Introduction to Spanish Conjugation

In Spanish, just like English there are many tenses; from pluperfect to present imperative they cover every linguistic need. A <keyword>**tense** is defined as a (rough) expression of the time frame in which an action takes place. 
For example, the following sentence is in the present.
>*I eat a big sandwich*
>*Como un bocadillo grande*

In English, to show who is doing the eating we use a subject pronoun: **I**, **You** (singular)<sup>†</sup>, **He/She/It**, **We**, **You** (plural) and **They**. In Spanish, they have subject pronouns but they are rarely used. Instead of pronouns, they conjugate the verb by altering its ending. These present tense endings are underlined:

|<u>To</u> eat|Com<u>er</u>|
|---|---|
|<u>I</u> eat|Com<u>o</u>|
|<u>You</u>(s.) eat|Com<u>es</u>|
|<u>He/She/It</u> eat|Com<u>e</u>|
|||
|<u>We</u> eat|Com<u>emos</u>|
|<u>You</u>(pl.) eat|Com<u>éis</u>|
|<u>They</u> eat|Com<u>en</u>|

So, if you wanted to say *we eat* you would take the verb infinitive *comer*, remove the -er and add the appropriate ending, *-emos*; this forms *comemos*.
Before you get too comfortable with that you have to understand the different classifications of verbs, called **declinations**. There are three declinations of regular Spanish verb, *-ar*, *-er* and *-ir*. Each of these declinations form different endings when **conjugated** (put into a tense and person).

|Infinitive|Habl<u>ar</u>|Com<u>er</u>|Viv<u>ir</u>|
|---|---|---|---|
||(Speak)|(Eat)|(Live)|
|<u>I</u>|Habl<u>o</u>|Com<u>o</u>|Viv<u>o</u>|
|<u>You</u>(s.)|Habl<u>as</u>|Com<u>es</u>|Viv<u>es</u>|
|<u>He/She/It</u>|Habl<u>a</u>|Com<u>e</u>|Viv<u>e</u>|
||||
|<u>We</u>|Habl<u>amos</u>|Com<u>emos</u>|Viv<u>imos</u>|
|<u>You</u>(pl.)|Habl<u>áis</u>|Com<u>éis</u>|Viv<u>ís</u>|
|<u>They</u>|Habl<u>an</u>|Com<u>en</u>|Viv<u>en</u>|
