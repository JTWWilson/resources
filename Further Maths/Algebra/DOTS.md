##Difference of Two Squares

Noticing that you have the difference of two squares can help factorise difficult equations. It takes the general form as follows:
**(a + b)(a - b) = a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>**  
This happens because the +ab and the -ab from FOIL cancel out, leaving you with only the squares.

Watch out for one square take another:

**Example: Factorise...**
>16x - 49y  =  (4x + 7y)(4x - 7y)

They might not obviously be squares:

>32x - 98y  = 2 × (16x - 49y)  =  2 × (4x + 7y)(4x - 7y)

###Trickier

This sort of pattern is relatively easy to spot so they are often disguised in questions.

**Example: Factorise...**
Just because x and y are at higher powers doesn't mean you can't use the difference of two squares, in fact any _even power_ will work:
> 4x<sup>6</sup> - 25y<sup>4</sup>  =  (2x<sup>3</sup> + 5y<sup>2</sup>)(2x<sup>3</sup> - 5y<sup>2</sup>)

###Practice

**Fully Factorise...**

1. 64x<sup>4</sup> - 16y<sup>4</sup>
2. 2x<sup>8</sup> - y<sup>6</sup>
3. 100x<sup>6</sup> - 144y<sup>14</sup>
