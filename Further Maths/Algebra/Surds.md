##Manipulating Surd

**Surds** are a way of writing the root of a non-square number without having to go into an infinite decimal. For instance, &radic;3 is a surd, along with 3&radic;2.

###Rules of Surds

When using surds, there are a few key rules:

>a = &radic;a × &radic;a = (&radic;a)<sup>2</sup>
>   
>&radic;a × &radic;b = &radic;(a × b)
>   
>&radic;a / &radic;b = &radic;(a / b)

###Simplifying Surds

To simplify a surd you divide the number under the root by the highest square number that can go into it, for example:

> &radic;18 = &radic;(9 × 2) = &radic;9 × &radic;2 = 3 &radic;2


When simplifying a fraction with a surd in the denominator, you have to _rationalise_ it:   

> 4 / (4 + &radic;3)

 Multiply both sides by the opposite half of completing the square; you've been given (a + b) so you multiply it by (a - b) to create a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>:
><u>\_\_4 (4 - &radic;3)\_\_</u>     
>(4 + &radic;3)(4 - &radic;3)

><u>16 - 4&radic;3</u>   
>          13
