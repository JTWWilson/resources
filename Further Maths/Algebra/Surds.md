##Manipulating Surds

**Surds** are a way of writing the root of a non-square number without having to go into an infinite decimal. For instance, &radic;3 is a surd, along with 3&radic;2.

###Rules of Surds

When using surds, there are a few key rules:

###Simplifying Surds

To simplify a surd you divide the number under the root by the highest square number that can go into it, for example:

When simplifying a fraction with a surd in the denominator, you have to _rationalise_ it:   

> ![simp 2](http://www.latex2png.com/output//latex_6f00c682d25f876fad2fff211b9d44b0.png)

 Multiply both sides by the opposite half of completing the square; you've been given (a + b) so you multiply it by (a - b) to create a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>
