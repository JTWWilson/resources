Differentiation
---------------------

### What is Differentiation?

At GCSE Maths, you learn that you can approximate the gradient of a curve at a given point using either a tangent or a chord. Both of these methods are relatively inaccurate, so that is why we use **differentiation**. We can use differentiation to find the exact gradient of a curve at any given point or to find the *rate of change* of any equation.

### Differentiating

There is only one formula to remember when differentiating:

![differentiation equation](http://latex2png.com/output//latex_b4e140467b2812052bb2948fe9e99c8a.png)


This can be read as *"the result of differentiating x<sup>n</sup> is nx<sup>n-1</sup>"*.

#### Examples

> Differentiate y when y = x<sup>5</sup>

In this example, n = 5 as that is our power of x. Therefore, the differentiated form will be:

> Differentiate y when y = 6x<sup>3</sup>

Here n = 3. When we have a coefficient of x, ignore it when differentiating and then remember to add it back in at the end. Therefore, the differentiated form will be:

> Differentiate y when y = 5.

When differentiating, we need every term to be a power of x. As x<sup>0</sup> = 1, we can write 5 as 5x<sup>0</sup>. Therefore, the differentiated form will be:

### Differentiation with multiple terms

When differentiating an equation with multiple terms, differentiate each term separately and then simplify at the end.

#### Example

> Find dy/dx when y = 6x<sup>4</sup> + 4x<sup>3</sup> - 2x + 1

We can treat this as 4 different differentiations: 6x<sup>4</sup>, 4x<sup>3</sup>, -2x<sup>1</sup> and 1x<sup>0</sup>. Therefore, the differentiated form will be:

### Using differentiation to find gradients

By differentiating the equation of a curve, we can find the gradient at any point of the curve by *"subbing in"* the x coordinate to our differentiated equation.

#### Example

> Find the gradient of the graph y = x<sup>2</sup> at x = 1 and x = -2

We must first of all differentiate the equation of the curve -- y = x<sup>2</sup> -- to find the gradient expression:

![differenation gradients 1](http://latex2png.com/output//latex_5c84d7d337dd08b6fc6fb9caa25c5404.png)

We can then substitute our values for x into the expression to find the gradient at any point on the curve:

* When x = 1, the gradient equals: 2 * 1 = **2**
* When x = -2, the gradient equals: 2 * -2 = **-4**

### Using differentiation to find rates of change

We can also use differentiation to find the rate of change. The *"rate of change of y with respect to x"* refers to how fast y is changing compared to x -- it's the same as finding the gradient

#### Example

> y = x(2x + 5)<sup>2</sup>; find the rate of change of y with respect to x when x = -1

We must first of all convert the equation into a form which we can differentiate; this means that we will need to expand the bracket and simplify:

![differentiation rates 1](http://latex2png.com/output//latex_d58e6b0ab3be0976939deb886e304b8a.png)

We can then differentiate this equation just like we would differentiate any other multi-term equation:

Finally, we can substitute x = -1 into this to get our final rate of change:
