##Index Laws

When performing mathematical operations to numbers with indices, different changes happen to the index. These are the only operations you must know:

###Multiplication

When multiplying two powers, you add the indices:
x<sup>3</sup> × x<sup>4</sup> = (x × x × x) × (x × x × x × x) = x<sup>7</sup>

###Division

When dividing two powers, you subtract the indices:
x<sup>3</sup> / x<sup>2</sup> = (x × x × x) / (x × x) = x<sup>1</sup> = x
 
###Raising to a power

When taking one power to another power, you multiply the indices:
(x<sup>2</sup>)<sup>5</sup> = (x × x)(x × x)(x × x)(x × x)(x × x) = x<sup>10</sup>


##Practice

Evaluate:


1. x<sup>5</sup> / x<sup>2</sup>
2. y<sup>2</sup> × x<sup>4</sup>
3. (x × x<sup>4</sup>)<sup>6</sup>
